Setup

Because this pulls from a .json file, it will need to be served up from a webhost. I am using WAMP, but any webhost such as XAMP or IIS will do.

When properly served, it can be accessed via localhost/Canada/index.html


Notes

- normally install with npm/bower, to save time/filesize, I've eliminated most files that aren't used

- ajax calls needs to be fleshed out with error handling (out of scope)

- could use some unit tests (out of scope)

- filter dialogue is not sizing to my satisfaction in medium and small formats. Could use some further tweaking.
